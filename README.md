KosherStream.org is a specialized music previewing platform designed for the Jewish community. It provides a clean, controlled environment for exploring music through iTunes and SoundCloud APIs, with built-in tools for administrators to manage content standards.

⚠️ Important Disclosure & Safety Warning
Please read this carefully before use:

Not "Automatically" 100% Kosher: This app is a tool, not a human authority. The "Strict Mode" and "Filter Engine" are only as effective as the settings provided by the Admin.

Filtering Limitations: If an Administrator whitelists an artist (e.g., "MBD"), the app will display all search results for that name. This may include songs that are not considered kosher or appropriate for all audiences.

Community Shield: Users are highly encouraged to use the Report Button if they encounter inappropriate content. The Administrator can then review these reports to block specific songs, block entire artists, or dismiss the claim.

Admin PIN Security: The Admin PIN is a soft-lock designed to prevent children or casual users from changing settings. It is not unbreakable. A person with technical knowledge or access to the browser's developer tools can potentially find or bypass the PIN. Do not use this as a foolproof security measure.

🛠 Features
Dual-Source Integration: Search millions of previews via iTunes and SoundCloud.

Admin Command Center: One-click toggles to block entire platforms or enable strict filtering.

Whitelist/Blacklist System: Granular control over which artists or keywords are permitted.

The "SoundCloud Guard": A dedicated space for loading specific SoundCloud links with content filtering applied.

Private Library: Save your favorite filtered tracks to your local browser storage.

📖 How to Use
For Users
Search: Use the search bar at the top to find music.

Report: If a song appears that should not be there, click the Report Icon (flag) to notify the Admin.

Library: Click the "Plus" icon to save a song to your personal library for quick access.

For Administrators
Access: Click the "Admin" tab in the sidebar and enter the default PIN (1234).

Platform Blocking: You can toggle "Block SC" or "Block iTunes" in the Command Center.

Note: Blocking these platforms only disables the Search and URL Loading functions. If a song is already saved in the Library, is currently playing on the screen, or was loaded before the block, it will continue to function.

Content Review: Visit the "Reports" tab regularly to see what users have flagged. You can choose to "Block Song" or "Block Artist" instantly from there.
